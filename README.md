# cleaningdata
Course project

The project uses six datasets, i.e. x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt.
Features.txt contains the variable name.
activity_labels.txt  contains the desciptive names for each activity label.

run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Merges the training and test datasets.
2. Extracts the mean and SD for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities according to activity_labels.txt.
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names. 
5. Create and print a new tidy data set with the average for each variable for each activity and subject, to newdata.txt.
